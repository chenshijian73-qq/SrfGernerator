Sleeping Beauty

Once upon a time there was a king and queen who had a beautiful daughter. Soon after her birth, seven fairies were invited to bless her.
Six of the fairies gave her gifts of a beautiful voice, graceful dancing, a quick wit and so on.
Unfortunately, the seventh fairy had not been invited to the meeting. She angrily said: "This child will prick her finger on a spindle and fall into a sleep from which she will not wake up until woken by the kiss of her true love, on her 15th birthday."
Sure enough on her 15th birthday,the princess pricked her finger on the spindle and fell into a deep sleep. The whole kingdom also fell asleep.
At last, one day a prince came to the kingdom and awoke Sleeping Beauty with a kiss from the spell. They lived happily ever after.

Sleeping Beauty wants to tell everyone that as long as you persevere, spring will come. Good night!

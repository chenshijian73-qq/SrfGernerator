Once upon a time there was a king and queen who had a beautiful daughter. Soon after her birth, seven fairies were invited to bless her.

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Six of the fairies gave her gifts of a beautiful voice, graceful dancing, a quick wit and so on.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Unfortunately, the seventh fairy had not been invited to the meeting. She angrily said: "This child will prick her finger on a spindle and fall into a sleep from which she will not wake up until woken by the kiss of her true love, on her 15th birthday."

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sure enough on her 15th birthday,the princess pricked her finger on the spindle and fell into a deep sleep. The whole kingdom also fell asleep.

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
At last, one day a prince came to the kingdom and awoke Sleeping Beauty with a kiss from the spell. They lived happily ever after.
